## We now have a [keybase team](https://keybase.io/team/perdola.public)

See the [latest patch notes here](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/perdola/commit/master).

A smart solution to the problem of passwords. Perdola generates passwords on demand, using the name of the app you're making a password for and a master password.

## How the versioning works

MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

MAJOR does not have to be breaking. It's really when I feel that a feature changes the way a user uses the site.

## Removed features

I have removed one feature so far and may remove more in the future for security / simplicity.

As of 09/07/2017 (Version 0.36) the ability to have your master password pre-entered, using a custom url, has been removed. This is due to the fact that your password would then show up in my google analytics.

This is also no longer an issue as, as of Version 6.8.0, Perdola no longer uses google analytics.

This feature was implemented in a safer fashion in v0.4, using cookies.

## To-do

- [ ] Add a tutorial (Maybe guided using [intro.js](https://introjs.com/))
- [ ] Add Unicode characters to passwords on presets that allow them
- [ ] React rewrite

## Software used for development

Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my text editor of choice.

All minimization is done using [Prepros](https://prepros.io).

I use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as my git GUI.
