See the [latest patch notes here](https://github.com/cloverleaf/web/commit/master).

A smart solution to the problem of passwords. Cloverleaf generates passwords on demand, using the name of the app you're making a password for and a master password.

## Software used for development

Microsoft's [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my text editor of choice.

All minimization is done using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

I use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) as my git GUI.

Thanks to [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) for making a glorious website that makes making favicons easy.

We use [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/cloverleaf) for localisation.
